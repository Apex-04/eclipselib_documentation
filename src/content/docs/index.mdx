## About eclipselib

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Design Language" icon="pencil">
	The Design Language for eclipselib is to provide a consistent structure for programs that is bot intuitive and powerful
	</Card>
	<Card title="Features" icon="document">
	eclipselib provides a number of default functions for teams to get a start with eclipselib without necessarily knowing some of the intricacies of vexide
	</Card>
	<Card title="Customization" icon="add-document">
	Within eclipselib we provide a structure is `src/robot.rs` to allow programmers to add advanced subsystems to the program, whether it be a lift that uses an external encoder rather then the v5 Smart Motor's Encoder

## About Us
eclipselib was developed to fill a void between a user-friendly approach to Vex Programming but also provide the ability to program without limitation, our team consists of the former Captain and Lead Programmer of V5RC 241 Eclipse, Andrew Bobay and a former Programmer of FRC 2658 Infinate Loop, Noah Lacorazza. in 2025 we joined VURC BBR1 out of the University of Maine, where we started developing Swerve Modules for use in VexU, but after we began considering the implications on programming we saw the need for a structured system to develop our codebase
