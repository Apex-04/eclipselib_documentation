title: Swerve Module Breakdown
---
Abstract:

In the FIRST Robotics Competition, Swerve Modules dominate every other type of drivetrain, they have the power efficiency of a Tank Drive, and the versatility of an X-Drive making them the clear choice. However in VEX Robotics the use of premade assemblies (which many swerve designs rely on) is illegal. Additionally due to the constraints of the VEX V5 Smart motors any attempts at a custom swerve drivetrain has either failed or has not fully utilized the capabilities of the system. In Early November of 2025, We began development of a – from scratch – Swerve System, With this system we have 3 Goals.
1. Create a Swerve Module that can be used on both, 15” and 24” Robots.
2. Not sacrifice any capability in order to utilize Swerve modules.
3. Document and Create a system for other teams to adapt into their own robots.

Note For Viewers:
	Due to the overall complexity of the swerve system, we felt it was necessary to document our process in this section; the entirety of the "Swerve Development" section refers to our process of developing the Swerve Module.

If you are implementing the Swerve System yourselves all we ask is that you cite us in your own documentation as such...
